          However, inheritance models used my most other languages are not
          the same as prototypal inheritance. By deeply understanding
          prototypal inheritance you'll be able to leverage the full power

        In JavaScript there are 5 primitive types: undefined, null,
        boolean, string and number.
        Bi-directional linking can be maintained by sticking to the rule:
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY&feature=youtu.be&t=30m">always having a '.'</a> in your ng-models.
        <!-- Scott
           <br/>
          Prototypal Inheritance<br/>
          Scope inheritance is normally straightforward, and you often don't
          even need to know it is happening... until you try 2-way data
          binding (i.e., form elements, ng-model) to a primitive (e.g.,
          number, string, boolean) defined on the parent scope from inside
          the child scope. It doesn't work the way most people expect it
          should work. What happens is that the child scope gets its own
          property that hides/shadows the parent property of the same name.
          This is not something AngularJS is doing â€“ this is how JavaScript
          prototypal inheritance works. New AngularJS developers often do
          not realize that ng-repeat, ng-switch, ng-view and ng-include all
          create new child scopes, so the problem often shows up when these
          directives are involved.

    <h2>AngularJS Scope</h2>
    <!-- Scott
    <br/>For the sake or this presentation:
    <br/>It is just an <b>OBJECT</b> and adheres to the prototypical JS inheritance:  inherits properties from its parent scope
    <br/><br/>During the template linking phase the directives set up $watch expressions on the scope. The $watch allows the directives to be notified of property changes, which allows the directive to render the updated value to the DOM.
    <br/>Both controllers and directives have reference to the scope, but not to each other. This arrangement isolates the controller from the directive as well as from DOM. This is an important point since it makes the controllers view agnostic, which greatly improves the testing story of the applications.

    <br/>scope is an object that refers to the application model. It is an execution context for expressions. Scopes are arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. Scopes can watch expressions and propagate events.

        <div class="wideCol"
        <pre width="500px">
        default (scope: false) - the directive does not create a new scope,
        so there is no inheritance here. This is easy, but also dangerous
        because, e.g., a directive might think it is creating a new property
        on the scope, when in fact it is clobbering an existing property.
        This is not a good choice for writing directives that are intended as
        reusable components.
        </pre>

        <p>
        scope: true - the directive creates a new child scope that
        prototypically inherits from the parent scope. If more than one
        directive (on the same DOM element) requests a new scope, only one
        new child scope is created. Since we have "normal" prototypal
        inheritance, this is like ng-include and ng-switch, so be wary of
        2-way data binding to parent scope primitives, and child scope
        hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.

        </p><p>
        scope: { ... } - the directive creates a new isolate/isolated scope.
        It does not prototypically inherit. This is usually your best choice
        when creating reusable components, since the directive cannot
        accidentally read or modify the parent scope. However, such
        directives often need access to a few parent scope properties. The
        object hash is used to set up two-way binding (using '=') or one-way
        binding (using '@') between the parent scope and the isolate scope.
        There is also '&' to bind to parent scope expressions. So, these all
        create local scope properties that are derived from the parent scope.

        </p><p>
        transclude: true - the directive creates a new "transcluded" child
        scope, which prototypically inherits from the parent scope. So if
        your transcluded content (i.e., the stuff that ng-transclude will be
        replaced with) requires 2-way data binding to a primitive in the
        parent scope, use $parent, or change the model to be an object and
        then bind to a property of that object. This will avoid child scope
        hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.
